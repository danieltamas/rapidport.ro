### `phase2-nuxt / bootstrap / bootstrap-nuxt` — merged to group branch

**Merge commit:** `0179d3b` (on `job/phase2-nuxt/bootstrap`, not yet merged to `main` — 6 more bootstrap tasks pending before group → main merge)

**Summary:** Minimal Nuxt 3 scaffold. TypeScript strict with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `noImplicitOverride`. Dev port 3015 (not Nuxt default 3000 — collides with Dani's other services). `typeCheck=false` in-build — explicit `nuxi typecheck` enforced by CI + `task-complete-gate.sh` hook. Nitro websocket experimental flag on for future SSE progress work. Core deps only (nuxt, vue, zod + TS/vitest dev); theme, fonts, Mantine, Drizzle, auth etc. deferred to their own tasks.

**Files:** `app/{package.json,package-lock.json,nuxt.config.ts,tsconfig.json,app.vue,pages/index.vue,.nvmrc}` created.

**Reports:** `jobs/phase2-nuxt/DONE-bootstrap-nuxt.md` + `jobs/phase2-nuxt/REVIEW-bootstrap-nuxt.md` (verdict: approved) — currently on group branch, will surface on main when group merges.

**Notes:**
- 6 moderate npm audit vulnerabilities reported, all in `vitest` dev dependency paths. Dev-only, zero runtime exposure. Deferred to a future `chore(nuxt): upgrade vitest to v4` task.
- Worker correctly surfaced a spec-vs-deps conflict (`typeCheck: true` needs `vue-tsc` as peer, not in spec's dep list) rather than silently adding the dep. Spec updated to `typeCheck: false` before resumption.
